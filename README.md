# Microservice project
Our project consists of creating a Human Resources plateform for employees looking for new job offers. 
Stack : SpringBoot - NodeJS - Eureka webservices  <br>

Our project has a microservices based architecture which relays on the usage of 6 main components (employee microservice / Job Offer microservice / Participation microservice / Participant microservice/ Job evaluation microservice /  Authentication microservice / Eureka Server / Node JS external microservice used for CV uploads) ###

<br>

Our cloud architecture will be based on a dockerization concept which enables our project to be deployed using docker images via 
docker compose file
